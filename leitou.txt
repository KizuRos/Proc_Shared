What you see depends on what you're looking for
Life is 10% of what happens to me and 90% of how I react to it
You may only be someone in the world, but to someone else, you may be the world
We must become the change we want to see
Neither fire nor wind, birth nor death can erase our good deeds
Not knowing when the dawn will come, I open every door
Obstacles are those frightful things you see when you take your eyes off your goal
We cannot direct the wind but we can adjust the sails
We must become the change we want to see
The inspiration of the almighty gives man understanding
